# Wagon Movement API - Software interface with hardware
#
# Once we've figured out where the wagon needs to be, this
# will be the interface we use to get the wagon moving in
# in the right direction.
#
# No logistic calculations should go here, this is for
# interfacing with hardware after the calculation has
# been made.
